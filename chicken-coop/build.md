# Chicken Coop Build

Following the plans laid out in this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPgSpktlf4g).

## Basic Structure

There are two of these structures, one for the right and left sides of the coop.

### Material

- 1x --- 4" x 4" x 10' pressure treated post 
- 2x ---  4" x 4" x 8' pressure treated post 

The top of the posts will need to be cut at a 15 degree angle to account for the slope of the roof. 

- 2x --- 2" x 4" x 12' pressure treated lumber 
- 2x --- 2" x 4" x 12' construction pine

###### Pressure Treated Lumber

- Pressure Treated Lumber: Wood infused with chemical preservatives.
- Purpose: Protects against rot, decay, and termite infestation.
- Applications: Used in outdoor settings like decks, fences, and landscaping.
- Durability: Resistant to rot and insects but still subject to wear and weathering.
- Safety Precautions:
	- Wear a dust mask and eye protection when cutting or sanding.
	- Wash hands after handling.
- Environmental Impact: Newer treatments are more environmentally friendly than older ones.

###### Tac Nailing

Tac nailing is a technique commonly used in roofing and construction. It involves the use of a nail gun or hammer to partially drive nails into roofing material or shingles, without fully seating them. This method is used to temporarily secure the material in place while further adjustments or alignments are made. Once the materials are properly positioned and aligned, the nails can be fully driven in to secure them permanently.

Use a frame nailer to build out each section and follow up by using exterior deck screws to fasten the pieces.
