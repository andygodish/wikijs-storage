# Framing Nail Gun

For my chicken coop build, I purchased the [M18 FUEL 21 Degree Framing Nailer](https://www.milwaukeetool.com/Products/2744-20#sp-specs) frmae nailer. 

## Nails

My project called for 3" galvanized nails. 

When buying nails, the first important measurement is the degree of the nailgun itself. Since mine is 21, I want to make sure I am buying 21 degree nails and not 30. 

### Galvanized

>The term "galvanized" in this context refers to a protective zinc coating applied to the nails. This coating provides a layer of protection against corrosion and rust, making galvanized nails ideal for outdoor projects or in environments where they might be exposed to moisture.

When filtering through my options at Home Depot, I noticed the following types of galvanized nails: 

> **Hot-Dipped Galvanizing (HDG):** This process involves multiple steps, including dipping the nails in a bath of molten zinc. This method can sometimes result in uneven zinc thickness and is susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement. Hot-dipped galvanized nails are characterized by a thicker zinc coating, which imparts a flat, gray color. They are particularly suitable for outdoor use and are ideal for pressure-treated lumber, which can corrode unprotected steel. However, they may not be the best choice for certain wood species like cedar and redwood, as the coating can react with oils in these lumbers​​.

> **Thermal Diffusion Galvanizing (TDG):** Also known as sherardizing, this process involves the vapor deposition of zinc, creating a uniform layer of protection even on threads and uneven surfaces. This method is increasingly used as an alternative to hot dip zinc galvanizing. TDG is often preferred for fasteners where a galvanized coating is desired but precise fit-up or alignment is critical, or for high strength fasteners that are susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement through the hot-dip galvanizing process

### Nail Shank Diameter	

Example dimensions: 3" x 0.131"

The second measurement represents the diameter of the nail. The thicker, the stronger. 

My nailgun has a specified range it will except: 

```
Nail Shank Diameter	.113” - .148”
```
