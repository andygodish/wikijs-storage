# Helm Pull

When I need to make modifications to helm charts, I typically pull the chart down by a specific version number and use a git repository to create my own branches/releases. These are documented to include changes made from the upstream chart. 

## List All Chart Versions

```
helm search repo rancher-stable -v
```

#### List versions of a specifc chart in a repo

```
helm search repo bitnami/etcd -l
```

## Helm Pull

- [Helm Docs](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_pull/)

Example: 

```
helm pull rancher-stable/rancher --version v2.6.6
```

You'll need to unpack the tgz file (`tar zxvf`) or use the `--untar` flag.
