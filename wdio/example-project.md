# WDIO

- [Docs](https://webdriver.io/)

A development team within my company uses webdriver.io to perform automating e2e testing of an application deployed within various environments. The testing suites are isolated from the application code in its own repository. This allows testers to plug in env variables associated with the environment they wish to test against.
