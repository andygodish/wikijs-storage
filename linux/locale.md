# Locale

A locale in a computing context refers to a set of parameters that defines the user's language, country, and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface. Typically a locale identifier consists of at least a language identifier and a region identifier.

## Local Verification 

### Ubuntu

- `locale`: This command without any arguments displays all the current locale settings for your session.

- `locale -a`: This command lists all the locales that are currently installed and available on the system.

- `printenv LANG`

These commands will give you an overview of the current locale configuration on your Ubuntu machine. If you want to change the system-wide locale settings, you would typically do this with the `update-locale` command or by editing the `/etc/default/locale` file. However, changing the locale system-wide requires root permissions.

## Ansible Example

```
- name: "[install] Set up en_US.UTF-8 locale"
  community.general.locale_gen:
    name: en_US.UTF-8
    state: present
  when:
    - "'Darwin' not in ansible_os_family"
    - "'RedHat' not in ansible_os_family"
  become: true
```
