# OhMyZSH

Configurations for oh my zsh are stored at your account's home directory in the `.zshrc` file. 

## Plugins

Add code for your plugin into the plugins directory at your $ZSH_CUSTOM path (by default `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`)


- [autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

## Store Aliases

Aliases can be added to your users .zshrc file. I usually throw mine at the end in a designated section. 

```
alias k=kubectl
```
