# Library

When using "local" storage for the media library, where does the data get stored within the filesystem?

- wp-content/uploads/...

> When you upload an image to the WordPress media library, WordPress automatically creates multiple sizes of that image. This is done to optimize the website's performance and to provide suitable image sizes for various use cases (theme displays, widgets, thumbnails, etc.).
