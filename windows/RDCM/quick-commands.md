# Remote Desktop Connection Manager

## Quick Commands

- `ctrl + g` - creates a new group as a child of the selected parent
- `ctrl + a` - creates a new server as part of the selected group
- `alt + enter` - Quickly edit the **properties** of the current resource

## Groups 

You’ll need to create your rdg files to properly organize your servers into groups. It’s important that you create your groups first as you will not be able to move servers to different groups once added.
