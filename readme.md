# Welcome to my Personal Wiki

This is a place for me to put my own technical documentation outlining processes/procedures pertaining to work and my homelab.

## About this Wiki

This wiki is powered by [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki/). I run a full deployment on a Kubernetes cluster in my homelab where all data is stored on a PostgreSQL database. At routine intervals, article data is synced to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andygodish/wikijs-storage/tree/main).
